## Hacking a hacking competition
If you use GitHub, you might have heard of Hacktoberfest, an open-source festival held during October of each year, sponsored by Digital Ocean. By signing up and completing a number of successful Pull Requests to GitHub repositories (approx. 5 as I recall) by the end of October, you will be rewarded with a themed t-shirt.

Setting the scene, we have an online challenge rewarding free t-shirts for submitting Pull Requests on GitHub, a set of circumstances begging for someone to gamify the system. Noticing the popularity of repositories advertising easy PR to cheat the system, I created Cutwell/Hacktoberfest-Census, a joke repository for users to complete 1/5 of their pull requests by simply signing their name in the README file, like a hotel guestbook.

I expected the repository to get a few requests, from my friend and perhaps the few users who chanced upon my repository. What I didn't expect was a flood of users submitting pull requests, eager for an easy ride to that free tshirt.

## Not everybody can take a joke

Not everyone in the community took it as a joke, however, it was here I recieved some rather stern words telling me to "feel bad" for creating the repository, as if my repository somehow forced every passing user to sully the concept of open-source contributing, rather than being a joke to not take seriously. These people where in extreme minority, however, as I recieved numerous offers for help with managing the now thousands of requests being recieved.

At the end of October, Digital Ocean summarised the most popular repositories being contributed to that year, and if I wasn't damned to see Hacktoberfest-census take the 2nd spot. Given how this repository was clearly riding against Digital Oceans vision for Hacktoberfest, I feared being barred from the festival, but it seems they weren't in a rush to stop anyone using this "exploit", since it took another successful year of census collecting in 2018, before they finally wrote a notice saying the repository had been excluded, and I decided to archive the repository to prevent any further pull requests.

_(This is where I would love to place a graphic showing Hacktoberfest-Census as a top repository, but sadly WaybackMachine didn't capture that data from the website, so it's lost to posterity.)_

## Final statistics
Over its 2 year lifespan, Cutwell/Hacktoberfest-Census recieved 102 Stars, 2.2k Forks, 3257 total Pull Requests. GitHub acknowledges 512 project contributors, and 2370 active pull requests were never merged/closed.

Did I enjoy my brief open-source infamy? At the time probably not, but damn if it isn't funny to look back on. The negative comments which worried me at the time are particularly entertaining, both at the misdirected outrage, and how poorly they aged, given Digital Oceans sloth attitude to banning the repository.

Would I open a similar gamify-ing repository? Given how Digital Ocean has cracked down on this form of "cheating" in recent years, any new "easy" pull request project would have to actually contribute to open-source in some way, so from my perspective if you can make a "cheat" repository which fulfils this criteria you aren't gamify-ing Hacktoberfest negatively, you're actually making open-source easy and approachable to get into, which fits the festival's tenets perfectly!
