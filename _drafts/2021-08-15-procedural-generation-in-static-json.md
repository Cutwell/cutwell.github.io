With such a grandious title, we hope we won't disappoint any readers by revealing that this project is, in other terms, about creating a Minecraft resource pack. This project tested the absolute limits of this form of content customisation, and produced some interesting insights.

We won't waste much time explaining what Minecraft is - being the best selling video game of all time, it has a pervading precense in popular culture, and is used in everything from [education]() to [architecture](), and has produced an astonishing number of [full-time careers]() through playing it.

Minecraft has enjoyed an active modding community since its creation, creating [custom game textures]() or more complex [expansions]() to the base game. Resource packs are a newer addition, offering an easier way for community developers to lever core game mechanics, without having to hack its source code.

A resource pack can be thought of a super-powered texture pack. Users can create new game textures with special rules, or modify existing items. Scripting is achieved through an unnamed pseudo-language (which allows users to modify the game world, similar to using a command-line terminal, but without easy access to features such as variables).

The inspiration for this project came after reading about procedural content creation, and how it is used in games to generate new content on-the-fly, in situations where it isn't feasible or cost-effective to create unique art by hand. An example of this content generation can be found in space exploration game "No Man's Sky", which uses procedural generation to generate everything from geography to flora and fauna.
