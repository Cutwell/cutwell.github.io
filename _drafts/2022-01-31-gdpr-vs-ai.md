- Create a model to generate text
- Train it to a list of email addresses
    - Overfit so model only generates from list, to prove point. 
    - Or generate so it will return an email from a prompt (the email index in dataset?)
    - Have model generate more data - maybe user age as well??
- If you want your data to be forgotten, then data in a database can simply be deleted 
- But data that’s been used to train an AI can’t simply be removed from the model- it’s being stored in an abstract way that’s inaccessible for audit. 
- This is a problem with GDPR rights, as I can’t comply with a demand to delete a users data, at least without retraining the model from scratch (which will be prohibitively expensive)
- Highlights an issue with data rights, but also illustrates how the model has learnt - it abstracted the data and stored it in a new format, where all data becomes intertwined in strange ways.
