_Return your laptop to it's glory-days by maximising its performance and expanding your screen-size._

I acquired my MacBook Air circa 2015. It's an 11-inch, early 2014 model, complete with a dazzling 1.4 GHz intel i5 processor, 120GB SSD storage and 4Gb of 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM.

Whilst, on paper, an increasingly underwhelming spec list by today's standards, this machine has been my "daily driver" for the last 6 years, and has seen me through A-Levels, a BSc, and hundreds of hours of use. While it's gaming days are mostly over, I still make use of it for simple tasks such as web-browsing, coding and writing essays on the go.

Keeping up with this constant use, and Apple's OS upgrades, has taken its toll. I've undergone numerous factory resets to clear up artefacts and cluttered data that slowly fill the meagre 120Gb storage, and recently replaced the battery after the original finally became too depleted to ignore.

Writing an article about a 7-year-old Apple product is the definition of niche, but I want to highlight a few tips and tricks I've successfully implemented to keep my laptop useful, in the hopes a few devices might be saved from becoming e-waste, or a really expensive paperweight. Whilst the tech is definitely old, this product is by no means down for the count, and with a few changes can be easily overhauled back into being a competitor for everyday use.

## 1 - Expanding screen real-estate by hiding the dock and menu bar.

![before](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/11.png "before") ![after](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/12.png "after")

_The difference and increase in real estate is definitely appreciable._

The modern MacBook Air (2020) system offers a 13.3 inch, 2560x1600 pixel screen, which compared to my 11.6 inch, 1366x768 pixel screen is a 390% increase in resolution, and 37% increase in screen real-estate.

This increase in screen size has given us increased expectations for our monitors, and if you transition between a modern PC monitor and the 11 inch MacBook Air often, this inequality is even more notable.

Compounding this is the amount of "clutter" in the Apple OS UI. "Clutter" is not a term people usually use to describe Apple's design philosophy, but in this case we can streamline the interface to ensure we're using our limited real-estate optimally. Both of these changes can significantly upgrade your visual experience with only minor compromise, and require changing just a couple settings.

It's at this point that you might ask "why don't you just full-screen your applications?", which is a valid point, and may be a better solution if you dislike my suggested setup. However, I would point out that a number of applications display differently (in some cases poorly) in full-screen mode, and the way Mac OSX moves full-screen apps to their own temporary "desktop" breaks exposé if you want to view all open program windows.

![hide dock and menu](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/2.png "hide dock and menu")

_Hide the dock and menu bar using these settings._

When enabled, the dock takes up 7.4% of your screen horizontally. If you often multi-task and switch windows, you likely use keyboard shortcuts or exposé to switch programs, instead of the dock, making it fairly useless once you've set up your work environment. By hiding the dock, you do lose one of the more distinctive features of OSX, but you gain an appreciable amount of screen space, which you'll instantly notice and appreciate.

The menu bar may only consume 3% of the screen vertically, but by removing it we can complete our DIY full-screen experience. In my experience, after hiding the dock this top bar becomes even more obvious, so hiding it in a similar fashion makes sense. I thought this change would be annoying, as I make regular use of these menus, but in practice hiding/showing the menu bar takes only a few milliseconds, and the overall aesthetic upgrade makes it well worthwhile.

## 2 - Reduce CPU and built-in graphics load by reducing transparency and animations.

![reduce transparency](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/31.png "reduce transparency") ![simple animations](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/32.png "simple animations")

_Reduce transparent elements and simplify animations using these settings._

While competitive at its inception, the 1.4 GHz Intel i5 processor and built-in Intel HD graphics chip have begun to suffer under the heavier loads of modern programs - even when idling the modern Apple OS.

To relieve some of the pressure, we can disable minor UI features that create inversely large pressure on the graphics chip.

Transparency allows tabs and other elements to have a slight fade effect, showing details of the wallpaper or program behind it. This effect is calculated in real time, and as such creates a significant load on the graphics chip. Reducing transparency removes this load, and can actually make tabs and menus easier to focus upon.

Animations can help to make the MacBook feel interactive, but like transparency also requires significant real time calculation. Disabling animations, or selecting simpler effects, can increase responsiveness, as less calculation is required before implementing the effect or action on screen.

## 3 - Maintain 20GBs of free storage for virtual memory.

![maintain free space](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/4.png "maintain free space")

_You can monitor and manage your SSD storage from the "About my Mac" window._

After 6 years of daily use, I've noticed that the MacBook Air will often dip into virtual memory in order to perform intensive tasks. Virtual memory is a method of expanding a computers available memory beyond its physical RAM by making use of SSD storage. Whilst significantly slower, it is often used by computers to store temporary data, in order to prioritise the RAM space for important processes.

To this end, I've determined that my system will begin to suffer once my available storage dips below the 20GB mark, and performance significantly degrades from 10GB and lower.

Advising you to keep 20GB of storage free on a system that only offered 120GB in the first place may be a tall order, but this rule has served me well and deserves a spot on this list.

## 4 - Install a better browser.

Chrome is a consumer favourite when it comes to web-browsers, and it's de-facto status as the browser most modern website developers test on and design for, not to mention its integration with omnipresent Google accounts, means that its difficult to justify switching.

However, this article is about improving MacBook Air performance, and there's no common program more resource intensive than Chrome. Case in point, it takes only a dozen Chrome tabs for my MacBook to heat up and whine its fans in protest, not to mention the drain on battery life and RAM, making multi-tasking a nightmare.

This is the point where many articles will recommend Safari, the pre-installed and optimised web browser built by Apple. But, try as I like, I just can't come to love Safari as much as I do Chrome, meaning that option is out. However, what if there was a way to retain all* the functionality of Chrome, whilst taming its desire to eat your RAM and battery life?

A previous incarnation of this article recommended Opera as a low-resource Chromium-based browser (and as you might note, many example screenshots in this article feature it). Opera even offers a further-optimised gaming browser to place hard limits on memory and CPU consumption.

However, researching the security of Opera has raised a few concerns. Whilst it's difficult to confirm or rebuke these claims, internet users have raised concerns of the browsers built-in VPN logging user data, it's acquisition by a Chinese company (meaning that data is possibly being shared with a foreign government), and general privacy concerns from it's Chromium origins.

I no longer use Opera, and instead have adopted the Firefox browser. Whilst no browser is without it's controversy, Firefox claims impressive privacy practices (and I've I've installed a number of open-source addons (such as password managers, site containers and other privacy-oriented extensions) to reinforce my privacy online further).

## 5 - Disable Spotlight and Disk Encryption.

![disable spotlight](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/61.png "disable spotlight") ![disable disk encryption](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/62.png "disable disk encryption")

_Spotlight and Disk Encryption can be useful when being used, but are otherwise a drain on your CPU._

Apple offers a couple utility and security features on your mac that you probably don't use or need. Spotlight is the built-in omni-search-tool, allowing you to search files on your laptop, the internet, maps, Siri suggestions, and more, all from one place. While it sounds impressive, I haven't used it once in all my years with Apple, and its indexing system (periodically cataloguing your files to ensure its search results are accurate) will eat significant resources whilst it runs.

You can select which categories of data Spotlight will catalogue from the settings menu, but if you want to go one step further and disable it completely, I recommend this 2 minute tutorial from [Technipages](https://www.technipages.com/macos-sierra-enable-disable-spotlight).

Disk Encryption isn't enabled by default, but you may have set it up when you initially configured your MacBook. If you're storing sensitive information on your laptop, then I will recommend keeping this feature on, but for the rest of us (who are unlikely to lose our devices, or have any significant data to lose), disk encryption serves only to slow down our machines.

What FileVault does is encrypt the data on your SSD using your password, requiring all new files to go through an encryption process before being saved (which takes time), and then be decrypted before they can be read (which takes even more time). These processes add significant delays to fetching data from the SSD and displaying it to the user, meaning that programs such as Finder will take a noticeable amount of time to load all the files in a folder.

## 6 - Use a faster DNS resolver

![advanced settings](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/71.png "advanced settings") ![DNS settings](/images/2022-04-15-optimise-macbook-air/72.png "DNS settings")

_Navigate to DNS under Advanced,  then simply update your DNS settings with 1.1.1.1 (and it's backup 1.0.0.1) to enjoy a faster DNS service._

When you navigate to a website on the internet, you typically use a websites domain name, for example: "https://www.google.com" or "https://cutwell.github.io". However, the servers hosting this content are actually identifiable using IP addresses, for example "216.58.212.132" (Google's IP in the Netherlands), or "185.199.110.153" (GitHub page's IP in the US). In order to make a request to a server, we need to translate the domain name to an IP address. This service is performed by a DNS (domain name system) resolver.

DNS resolvers present an obvious bottleneck in performance, as we have to query the service for every website we want to visit (unless it's locally cached). Although these requests are very simple, if the service we use is slow (or incomplete, meaning it has to make _another_ request to a different DNS to get the answer), then you're waiting around for a page to load even longer.

[1.1.1.1](1.1.1.1) is a DNS resolver service offered by Cloudflare which claims [top performance](https://www.dnsperf.com/#%21dns-resolvers=) versus other platforms. What's more it also claims to be privacy-oriented and is completely free to start using.

## To conclude..

While there is no magic "go faster" button for the MacBook Air, Apple does offer numerous ways to keep the older devices competitive, and it's heartening to see projects like the Firefox browser working to create lightweight and resource-friendly browsers in a world of RAM and CPU-hungry applications.

Thanks for reading this article, I hope one or more of these tips will prove useful. Apple may be known for an aggressive release-cycle of new products each year, but with a little care their technology is built to last.
