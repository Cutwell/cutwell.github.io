I recently finished [`The Dark Forest`](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest) by Liu Cixin (translated by Joel Martinsen), and found the use of the Dark Forest theory to be an excellent use of real life game theory in science fiction.

## Life in the Universe
Consider the following axioms: 1. life on our planet arose due to natural coincidences (atmosphere + climate producing water, siesmic activity releasing necessary chemicals, etc.), and 2. these conditions, whilst rare, are not unique. Accepting both of these as being true, then life can be assumed to naturally arise as an inevitable outcome, at least within the vastness of the universe, or even within relatively local space such as our galaxy. 

We have strong evidence that microbial life is not necessarily unique to Earth, with evidence from Mars suggesting life existed there some 3.9 billion years ago, before the planet lost it's atmosphere and water [\[1\]](1). What this is not evidence of, however, is intelligent life evolving from this microbial state.

## Where are all the aliens?
The Fermi Paradox asks the simple question; "but where is everybody?". Given the age of the universe, it can seem unreasonable that we are yet to encounter any signs of intelligent life. Despite optimism from numerous institutions, such as [SETI](https://www.seti.org/) and other Government-backed projects, decades of research are yet to provide evidence that to solve the paradox.

## The dark forest
Numerous solutions exist to resolve Fermi's question, considering inevitablity of natural disaster disrupting civilisations, vast distances between instances of life, isolationism, and the idea Earth might be deliberately ignored due to our civilisations immaturity. Whilst each of these concepts have merit, the most convincing, and perhaps most dramatic, is the Dark Forest hypothesis. 

Sharing a brief excerpt from his novel, Liu Cixin illustrates interstellar civilisation:

> The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds another life â€” another hunter, angel, or a demon, a delicate infant to tottering old man, a fairy or demigod â€” thereâ€™s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them.

The logic behind the theory is based on two axioms:
1. Resources in the universe are finite, civilisations will compete for resources.
2. You can't determine if another civilisation is good or bad before making contact.

Following these principles, a civilisation encountering another must make one of three choices, however following the dark forest hypothesis, only one choice is optimal.
1. Make contact with the civilisation - diplomacy.
2. Ignore the encounter (if the civilisations existance hasn't been revealed already) - isolationism.
3. Seek to destroy the other civilisation.

### Technological explosion
The risk behind revealing oneself to a lesser civilisation, one determined to not be an immediate threat, is the potential for technological explosion. Upon encountering advanced technology, a lesser civilisation may quickly emulate or acquire these advancements, becoming equally powerful. This changes the threat assessment of the civilisation, and can occur so rapidly that counter-measures are not possible. Reviewing the advances in 200 years of Human civilisation, and associated changes in society, a newly contacted civilisation might change it's nature inbetween first contact and whenever physical contact is made, potentially becoming hostile.

### Isolationism
Assuming, even with technological advancements, it remains difficult to review planets for signs of intelligent life, the path of isolationism could be a safer route for a civilisation. However, this relies on other civilisations encountered to be technologically inferior, and that the chance discovery of our own civilisation is considered an acceptable risk.

### The Hunter
Should we encounter another civilisation, and our existence is revealed (or the path of civilisation suggests our discovery is inevitable), then the risks of remaining passive or friendly might be considered far too high against such an existential threat.
